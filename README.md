# GitClean

A script to batch transfer ownership of repositories to clean up your GitHub profile.

## Before Usage

There are comments within the `script.js` file which should make usage easier but please edit the settings so that it fits your use case. It may also help to create organisations before running the script as this does not generate organisations for you.

Once you have finished setting up, simply run `node script.js` in the root directory.
